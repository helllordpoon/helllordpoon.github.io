         <p>Often, the color palette within pixel art is limited. In previous years (we're talking a couple decades at this point), the limit in color count was due to the limits of game consoles or display on a computer monitor. As such, a technique known as dithering was employed. Dithering is the staggering of two colors in order to blend them together without having to involve extra colors. The pattern an artist uses, either style of staggering pixels or density of dithering, contributes to how well the colors blend. It's similar in style to the artistic technique of stippling.</p>
